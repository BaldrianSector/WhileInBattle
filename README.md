# While in battle I'm free, never free to rest

As a school project, I was asked to come up with a visual identity for the dance performance "While in battle I'm free, never free to rest" for Metropolis festival 2024.

## Using Creative Code as a design tool

I’ve been playing around with [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for a while, and it seemed like the perfect tool to manipulate photos. The effect is accomplished with [beginShape()](https://processing.org/reference/beginShape_.html) using quad strips to copy specific parts of an image.

Our professor, [Stig Møller Hansen](https://stigmollerhansen.dk/), gave some great examples and provided initial technical guidance. I highly recommend checking out [his Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stigmollerhansen/), where he shares processing remakes of graphical media.

You can find a hosted version of [the repo here.](https://never-free-to-rest.netlify.app/)
